# Tremolo VST Project for Audio Processing and Indexing

This repository contains code for the Seminar Audio Processing and Indexing 2022/2023 project at Leiden University. For this project we have created a virtual Tremolo audio effect that can be used for digital audio workstations (DAW) such as FL studio. 

Some audio samples before and after the effect can be found here [TO DO]. This project is built using C++ with the [JUCE framework](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE).

## Getting Started

To get started and use the Tremolo VST, you should download the project as a ZIP or clone the project. You should also have installed a DAW on your computer such as FL studio. A fully-functional, free trial version with unlimited time for FL Studio can be found [here](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/). The download is available for Windows 8, 10 or 11, and MacOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra) or later.
